## JavaScript Books Recommendation

Context:

Since I didn't know who to ask for help, I've decided to [ask](https://twitter.com/alexandracaulea/status/1315376373301641216) the community on Twitter to give me a book recommendation to continue learning JavaScript, since my level is somewhere between junior and middle.

They were so kind and recommended me so many authors and books, and I decided to save those in this repo, so I can quicky access them and start reading.
